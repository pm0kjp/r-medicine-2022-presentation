## Section 1: Census Data

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}

## Section 2: Public Data Portals

## Section 3: Mapping With Leaflet

In this section, we're going to talk about several topics:

* Maps as a data visualization idiom
* Choropleths

## Map as Idiom: Example 1

What do you see in this reconstruction of a 12th century data visualization?

## Map Files

*   GeoJSON (IETF Standard)  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946  (usually one file)
*   Shapefile (ESRI standard) https://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf  (usually multiple files in a .zip)

Along with many folks (see, e.g. http://switchfromshapefile.org/) , I believe that geoJSON is a better format than Shapefile, but this is mostly due to the fact that JSON itself is so well-understood and easy to work with, so it’s a simpler jump for me.  Your needs may be different!

There are others with smaller market share:

*   [OGC GeoPackage](http://switchfromshapefile.org/#geopackage)
*   [OGC GML](http://switchfromshapefile.org/#gml)
*   [SpatiaLite](http://switchfromshapefile.org/#spatialite)
*   [OGC KML](http://switchfromshapefile.org/#kml)

## Working With Map Files

Let’s just start working with some map files to see what they look like under the hood.  
All of my files can be found at https://github.com/pm0kjp/mapping-geographic-data-in-r or https://rstudio.cloud/project/334226  (YMMV)
